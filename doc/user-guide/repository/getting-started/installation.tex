There are two ways to install the \skbacft{A3DS:SKB}. The first option is have it 
automatically installed by your \LaTeX~distribution using \TeX Life 
or the \skbacft{TeX:CTAN} archive\footnote{Note: Version 0.5 of the \skbacft{A3DS:SKB} has been submitted
to \skbacft{TeX:CTAN} and is available at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/skb/.
But it will take a while to reach all mirrors and even longer for TeX Live and 
automatic installation with your prefered \TeX~distribution}. The second option
is a manual installation doing the following steps:
\begin{skbnoteenum}
  \item Go to your \LaTeX~distribution to the folder \skbem[code]{tex/latex}.
  \item Create a folder \skbem[code]{skb}.
  \item Copy all files from the directory \skbem[code]{run} of this package to the 
        newly created folder \skbem[code]{tex/latex/skb}.
  \item Update the filename database of your \LaTeX~distibution. Please see the 
        manual or help files of your \LaTeX~distribution for details.
\end{skbnoteenum}

\noindent If you want copy the source and documentation files as well, then do the 
following steps. We start with the documentation:
\begin{skbnoteenum}
  \item Go to your \LaTeX~distribution to the folder \skbem[code]{doc/latex}.
  \item Create a folder \skbem[code]{skb}.
  \item Copy all files from the directory \skbem[code]{doc} of this package to the 
        newly created folder \skbem[code]{doc/latex/skb}.
\end{skbnoteenum}

\noindent And now the source files of the \skbacft{A3DS:SKB}:
\begin{skbnoteenum}
  \item Go to your \LaTeX~distribution to the folder \skbem[code]{source/latex}.
  \item Create a folder \skbem[code]{skb}.
  \item Copy all files and directories from the directory \skbem[code]{source} of this package to the 
        newly created folder \skbem[code]{source/latex/skb}.
\end{skbnoteenum}

Now you have installed the \skbacft{A3DS:SKB} and you are ready to use it.
