\DescribeMacro{\skboptionsused}
This macro will print out a warning including the currently used configuration 
information and the change list for each of them. For example, if the configuration
for \skbem[code]{root} has not been changed the output for \skbem[code]{root} will be

\skbem[code]{- root [skb.sty]: /doc}

but if the configuration for \skbem[code]{fig} has been changed using
\cmd{\skbconfig} to \skbem[code]{graphics} the output for \skbem[code]{root} will be

\skbem[code]{- fib [skb.sty, skbconfig]: graphics}

This macro is automatically called at the end of processing.

When creating the documentation for the \skbacft{A3DS:SKB} by running \skbem[code]{pdflatex skb.dtx},
the following output will be created:
\lstinputlisting[style=generic]{\skbfileroot{examples/used-options}}

The change log shows that all configuration options have been set by \skbem[code]{skb.sty} and later 
by \skbem[code]{skb.cfg}. Furthermore, the configuration option \skbem[code]{root} has 
been changed by \skbem[code]{skb.dtx}.
