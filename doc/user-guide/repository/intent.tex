\opt{text}{\skbheading{The Intent}}

Provide a \LaTeX~package that helps to create and maintain a repository for long-living documents. It's 
probably not usefull for some short-term articles, however, I learned that most of my short term articles 
eventually become part of my long-term documents. Here you go. The repository should allow for easy access
to 'stuff': text blocks, senteces, paragraphs, sections, complete chapters. But also to figures, code 
sniplets, examples, etc. And I do want to limit the amount of repetition of information. For example, if 
I use a certain example in an article I might want to use the same (identical) example in a book or a 
presentation or lecture notes. If I only copy the example I have to maintain several sources, and over time 
I will not remember which of them is normative. As a side effect, I also want to optimise document creation
and limit the \LaTeX~or document class specific code in my documents.
