-------------------
Create and maintain a repository for long-living documents

This package provides  macros that help  to build a  document repository for
long living  documents. It  focuses on  structure and  re-use of text, code,
figures etc. The basic concept  is to first separate structure  from content
(i.e. text about  a topic from  the structure it  is presented by)  and then
separating the  content from  the actual  published document,  thus enabling
easy re-use  of text  blocks in  different publications  (i.e. text  about a
protocol in a short article about this  protocol as well as in a book  about
many protocols); all without constantly copying or changing text. As a  side
effect, using the document  classes provided, it hides  a lot of LaTeX  from
someone who just wants to write articles and books. 

skb.sty v0.5            : the skb package
skbarticle.cls v0.5     : an article class based on memoir
skbbook.cls v0.5        : a book class based memoir
skbbeamer.cls v0.5      : a beamer class based on beamer v3.10
skblncsbeamer.cls v0.5  : a class for annotated beamer slides
skblncsppt.cls v0.5     : a class for annotated ppt slides

See for more information the PDF documentation of this package. The  history
of  the  package  is  documented  in  /source/HISTORY.TXT  and  in  the  PDF
documentation.



Status: Alpha, Experimental
---------------------------

This package, while being  used by me and  some early adaptors, is  still in
alpha status, thus experimental. We are using it to maintain a large  amount
of documents  (articles, lecture  notes, some  books, project documentation,
open source  documentation) and  various different  platforms (Windows  with
MikTeX, several Linux systems  and OSX). Since we  eat our own dog  food, we
are fairly confident that the package  does it's job well. However, this  is
not  written by a LaTeX expert, I am still  learning, and the package  might
or  might  not  be usefull  for you  and might  or might  not work  on your
machine.   We   are    very   interested   in   comments,   critic,  advice,
recommendations, complaints; as long as you try to keep them contructive ;)



Contents and Installation
-------------------------

Your LaTeX  distribution might  have the  skb package  already installed  or
might install it automatically when you are trying to use it the first time.
If you have  to manually install  it, copy the  files listed below  to their
respective  locations   within  your   LaTeX  distribution   (TSD  compliant
structure). Once you  copied all files,  please don't forget  to update your
filename database. To use  the skb package, you  probably only need to  copy
the files from the /run folder

[archive root]
 |
 +-- doc
 |    +-- skb.pdf           : [your tex distribution]/doc/latex/skb
 |    +-- ug-slides-anim    : [your tex distribution]/doc/latex/skb
 |    +-- ug-slides-noanim  : [your tex distribution]/doc/latex/skb
 |    `-- ug-slides-notes   : [your tex distribution]/doc/latex/skb
 +-- source
 |    +-- skb.dtx           : [your tex distribution]/source/latex/skb
 |    `-- skb.ins           : [your tex distribution]/source/latex/skb
 `-- run
      +-- skb.cfg           : [your tex distribution]/tex/latex/skb
      +-- skb.sty           : [your tex distribution]/tex/latex/skb
      +-- skbarticle.cls    : [your tex distribution]/tex/latex/skb
      +-- skbbeamer.cls     : [your tex distribution]/tex/latex/skb
      +-- skbbook.cls       : [your tex distribution]/tex/latex/skb
      +-- skblncsbeamer.cls : [your tex distribution]/tex/latex/skb
      `-- skblncsppt.cls    : [your tex distribution]/tex/latex/skb

The   archive   contains  pre-generated  files   (in  the   /doc   and  /run
folders).  You  can  reproduce  them from  the  source  (/source)  using the
docstrip command and the ltxdoc package usting the following commands:

  $ cd run
  $ latex ../skb.ins
  $ cd ../doc
  $ pdflatex ../skb.dtx
  $ pdflatex ../skb.dtx
  $ pdflatex ../skb.dtx

This will create  the style file  (skb.sty), the general  configuration file
(skb.cfg) and the class files (*.cls)  in the directory run and the  package
documentation in the directory doc You need to have docstrip, ltxdoc and doc
installed, which should be already part of your LaTeX distribution. Parts of
the documentation (the user guide) are in the folder doc/user-guide and  you
will need to  install the SKB  before you can  create the documentation  (in
other words, the SKB package uses itself to compile the PDF document)



Configuration
-------------

The SKB comes with a default  configuration in the package (skb.sty) and  an
external  configuration  file  (skb.cfg).  There  are  multiple  options  to
configure  the  SKB   (changing  the  coniguration   file,  using  a   local
configuration  file  called  skblocal.cfg   or  using  the  provided   macro
\skbconfig). Please refer to the user guide for details.
