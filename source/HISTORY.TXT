2011/06/03 v0.52
- changed directory and package structure to be CTAN conform
- re-worked README to reflect new package structure, and added information on generating files from the source

2011/05/12 v0.51
- worked on the documentation, lots of changes
- fixed a typo in skb.cfg, which made the bibliography file unloadable
- changed linkcolor from AntiqueWhite4 to Brown4
- added acronym database (short version of the automatically generated) and acronym handling in the documentation
- removed \SKB, appropriately it's now an acronym rather than a special type setting
- added bibtex load to the documentation
- removed call to \cmd{\skbbibtex} from class files, users need to call that now manually. reason is that otherwise
  configuration changes for bib/bibfile have no effect
- changed load mechanism for the user guide, due to bibtex load problems
- changed the two skbnote environments (list/enum), removed unnecessary temp storage
- \textbf{changed default acronym file name to acronyms, note the added 's'}
- added skbmoderncv class using the moderncv package and adding some macros for reference lists using biblatex

2010/08/04 v0.5
- this is the first version on CTAN: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/skb/
- added example describing how the \SKB~uses itself to create parts of its documentation
- removed the redefinition of \title and \author, since they intererred with the beamer package definitions of these macros.
  added \skbtitle and \skbauthor instead.
- added RequiredPackage in the class skbbeamer before loading beamer to load xcolors with x11names
- added test for nemoir class: if loaded, then skbnotelist and skbnoteenum will have no effect; if not loaded, then the package
  booktabs will be loaded (for top/mid/bottomrule
- added test for beamer package: depending if beamer or beamerarticle are loaded, the SKB will initialise a few newe ifs
- added required package dirtree, and redefinition of some dirtree styles
- added two options to the \SKB package: beameranim and beamernoanim
- added the package versions with the environments: skbmodetext, skbmodenote and skbmodeslide
- added the package optional with the options: text, note, slide, anim and noanim
- internally, the package optional also provides memoir
- changed the documentation, moved manual description to user guide in folder /doc, moved history.tex into the dtx file and
  changed most of the actual documentation (still not finished though)
- skbbeamer: corrected load of beamer package
- skblncsbeamer: moved load of skb after beamerarticle to allow skb to create proper options
- added \providecommand for \DescribeMacro and \cmd, so that we can use the user-guide in the dtx and stand-alone
- added conditional load of skb.dtx in the driver
- changed the sequence of definitions in the dtx file, again, hopefully the last time
- bug fixes (SF=sourceforge):
  + SF\#3032749 (skboptionsused doesn't work) -- fixed, changed \skb@setCfgVars
  + SF\#3032752 (history section for v0.4 has wrong date) -- fixed, changed the heading
  + SF\#3032754 (skb.cfg missing/empty) -- fixed, changed the installer (skb.ins) to generate it and my local scripts to put it into /run
  + SF\#3033124 (renewcommand title/author doesn't work) -- fixed, no renewcommand anymore, two new commands to set author/title for pdfinfo
  + SF\#3038935 (skbinput not working w/o from) -- fixed, can load from root directory now
- new commands
  + \skbtitle -- title for PDF info
  + \skbauthor -- author for PDF info
  + \skbslide -- load slides and annotations
  + \skbslidecite -- for citations on slide annotation pages
- changed commands:
  + \skbinput -- added option to load tex files from figures directory (option fig)
- replaced commands:
  + \SkbLoadSlideNotes => replaced by \skbslide with option annotate and first argument only
  + \SkbLoadSlideNotesDifferent => replaced by \skbslide with option annotate and both arguments
  + \SkbLoadSlideNotesExtern => replaced by \skbslide with option annotate and both arguments and option notefrom set
  + \SkbLoadSlideNotes => replaced by \skbslide without annotate and first argument only
